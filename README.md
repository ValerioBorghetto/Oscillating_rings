## Description

The problem considers two concentric vertical ferromagnetic rings connected by a wire, with the larger ring also attached to the floor by another wire. They are then subjected to a magnetic field. The terms introduced in the Hamiltonian are:

-Kinetic term for each ring
-Elastic potential for both wires
-Interaction between the magnetic moment of both rings and the external field

For the latter, we considered the magnetic interaction due to two magnetic dipoles, since the magnetisation acts in first approximation just to the upper part of the rings.

## Libraries
The project is in Pythin, and uses the following libraries:
- To compute: **Numpy**, **Sympy** and **Scipy**;
- For the graphics: **Matplotlib** and **VPython**.
